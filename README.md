## Project's Informations

Please note that I started working on this project 3 days before the dead line (thanks to school...).

For this project I started by creating a figma maket that you can see by [clicking there](https://www.figma.com/file/Z3J8mRL8NyuCaVf2WGvUU5/Product-Page?node-id=0%3A1&t=WbP2TfDhpHPLRM4P-1).

Thanks to this challenge, I started discovering the (really awesome) ThreeJs library.
